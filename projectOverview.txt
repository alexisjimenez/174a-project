AVData

Compiling Paillier Library:
	  We went to google and typed in paillier c. Then we clicked on the first link
	  shown and downloaded the library. We then added the paillier.c and paillier.h
	  file into another AWS named AVData2.

Compiling encrypt.c and decrypt.c:
	  We could not get our encrypt.c and decrypt.c to compile on the desktop of our
	  mac since gmp was not installed. We tried to install gmp, but it still would 
	  not work. We therefore created another AWS instance called AVData2 and trasferred
	  in the files encrypt.c and decrypt.c. We then compiled them with:
	  gcc -o encrypt encrypt.c paillier.c -lgmp
	  gcc -o decrypt decrypt.c paillier.c -lgmp

Compiling SUM_HE.c:
	  We compiled our encrypted sum salary function on the our ubuntu AWS called AVData1  and then 
	  sent the SUM_HE.so file to our mysql server.To compile the file we entered:
	  gcc -fPIC -I/usr/include/mysql -shared -o SUM_HE.so SUM_HE.c -lgmp
	  We then entered mysql remotely from our ubuntu AWS by typing mysql -u root -p 
	  and then typed in out password. Through mysql, we typed 
	  CREATE AGGREGATE FUNCTION SUM_HE pressed enter and then typed 
	  RETURNS STRING SONAME "SUM_HE.so"; and then pressed enter.

Running our client interface:
	We coded our client interface in python. To run it, we put our part5split.py file inside AVData2 AWS instance
	where the encrypt and decrypt executables are at and the paillier.c and paillier.h. 
	We than had to install mysql.connector using command:
	pip install --user --allow-external mysql-connector-python mysql-connector-python
	We ran python part5split.py. This will connect to the AWS and
	also to mysql.This enteres the user command prompt.
